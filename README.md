# Reactive Microservices with Spring Boot 2.0 and Cassandra

This repository contains the sources and [documentation](docs/LABDOC.md)  for a hands-on workshop with Spring Boot 2.0 and [Apache Cassandra](tools/apache-cassandra-3.11.1-bin.tar.gz)

The aim of this workshop is to show you the new reactive features of Spring by helping you develop a small example project consisting of two REST-based services along with a simple persistence example using Apache Cassandra.

# Running the code

The project is a Maven project, so you will need to have Maven installed. The project was in IntelliJ IDEA developed, but it should also work with Eclipse.

In order to start the application you have to run the main application class `de.virtual7.reactivelab.ReactiveLabApplication`
